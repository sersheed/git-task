Compression Tools:

- Compression tools are used to compress one or

more files or an archive to save space.

#- gzip

This command creates a compressed file of each of the

files specified and adds .gz extension to the files.

#- gzip filename

#- ls or ll (check files after compression)



- To uncompress use:

#- gunzip filename

or

#- gzip -d filename

# ls or ll (check files after decompression) 

You can also use bzip2 and bunzip2

#- bzip2 filename

#- bunzip2 filename or bzip2 -d filename



cat /etc/profile

Displays the contents of the file profile.

- Using more and less command: 

Examples: 

#- more /etc/profile

Displays long text files one page at a time, starting

at the beginning.

- Use spacebar to scroll forward one screen at a time.

- Use Enter to scroll one line at a time.

#- less /etc/profile

Similar to more command but offers some extended

capabilities, it is also faster than more as it does

not need to read the entire file before it starts to

show.
